During Defcon finals, an unintended bug was discovered
in the checking of mailbox names.  Many, but unfortunately
not all, of the functions in the first released version of 
imap properly checked that the mailbox name provided by the
user didn't contain any directory traversal characters like
 ".." and "/".  Because of the few functions that didn't 
properly check, it was possible to traverse out of the
logged in user's directory and inspect other files
on the system.  We released a imap1a version to patch this
issue.

In addition to the bugs intentionally written into the 
source of the imap2 binary, a stack canary leak was 
inserted into the binary by manual patching.  This bug 
is documented in the cmd.c source with a comment that 
starts with "BUG".
